All common libre licenses at the time of writing this license contain at least one clause restricting the rights of the
recipient of the work beyond what is required under a copyright law system. These can include, but are not limited to,
requiring disclosure of source code upon request, requiring a link to the original authors website or page, requiring
that private keys of tivoized devices be disclosed to user upon request, etc. In fact, I was only able to find one
license that did not restrict the rights of any recipient without any additional clauses, that being CC-SA 1.0, which
unfortunately was discontinued after the first version due to lack of demand. This license was created to fill the gap.

The only restrictive clause that is required to protect a recipients rights is that when a work is redistributed, that
it be redistributed under the same license without any sublicensing. This clause in necessary for everyone who receives
this work to receive it as libre, otherwise they would not know and assume that they are being provided it as ARR or a
different license.

In addition to the protections in CC-SA 1.0, this license is also strongly infective. This is so that the rights of
anyone receiving this work in any capacity are protected. The DNCPL will have this infectivity removed, so it may be
more suitable for some libraries, though users who receive the work in the capacity of a larger work might not be
granted the same protections.
